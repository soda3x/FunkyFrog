Funky (and pretty buggy) frogger clone written in Java using the LibGDX game engine for both PC and Android.

It is actually the **funkiest** frogger clone in existence *.

## Reasons it's funky

1. Starring Funkmaster Frog

2. Has funky music

3. Is funky

I did some cool stuff to get the music all synced with menu transitions and stuff :)
